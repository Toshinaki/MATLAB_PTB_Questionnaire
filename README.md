# MATLAB_PTB_Questionnaire
Display a questionnaire using psychtoolbox, and get input using keyboard

Run a demo by executing runSurvey.m

Control keys:
  1. Arrow keys -- up, down for question; left, right for answer
  2. ESCAPE key -- quit loop (for now, you need to input "sca" to close the screen)

Todo:
  1. ENTER for recoding selection
  2. save selections to a file
  3. Is there a way to register key-press instead of the ugly "if elseif end".
